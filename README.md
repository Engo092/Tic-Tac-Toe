# Tic Tac Toe Game (W.I.P)

This is another project from The Odin Project, being a Javascript Tic Tac Toe game. It is meant to be an introduction to concepts such as factory functions, module patterns, private functions and related concepts.

Currently this project is in a W.I.P phase and is not fully functional, but the basic functions are already there. You can right now play on the board, but no winning condition or anything is ever checked, and you should restart the page if you want to play again, which is not very convenient.

By the end of this project it should have at least some kind of display, as well as a winner check and i do plan on creating some kind of computer AI as well with the minimax algorithm, which i already have an idea on how to do as in the CS50ai course i had to do a very similar assignment.
