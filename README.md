# Tic Tac Toe Game (W.I.P (no A.I yer))

This is another project from The Odin Project, being a Javascript Tic Tac Toe game. It is meant to be an introduction to concepts such as factory functions, module patterns, private functions and related concepts.

Currently this project is mostly finished, and you can input both player's names and play Tic Tac Toe with yourself or someone else, with the code displaying the winner when a winning condition is met. So far i haven't found any bugs as well, which is always good.

The only thing left to add in this project is a computer A.I that uses the minimax algorithm, which i already have an idea on how to do as i created something similar in the CS50AI course that i finished a while back.
