# Tic Tac Toe Game (W.I.P (no A.I yer))

This is another project from The Odin Project, being a Javascript Tic Tac Toe game. It is meant to be an introduction to concepts such as factory functions, module patterns, private functions and related concepts.

Currently this project is mostly finished, and you can play it against yourself or someone else as most functions work fine, but it is very simple and there are some missing features.

By the end of this project it should have at least some kind of display, as well as a winner check and some kind of computer AI that uses the minimax algorithm, which i already have an idea on how to create as in the CS50ai course i had to do a very similar assignment.
